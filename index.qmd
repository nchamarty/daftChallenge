# The Scurvy Story: A Data Science Tragedy

Scurvy was a devastating disease that affected sailors on long voyages. The cure was discovered in 1747, but due to a misunderstanding about the cause, the cure was lost for over 150 years. The story involves three different understandings of the data generating process:

1. **1747 Understanding:** Lemons prevent scurvy (correct but incomplete!)
2. **Misguided Belief:** Acid kills bacteria that causes scurvy (wrong!)
3. **1928 Understanding:** Vitamin C prevents scurvy (the real mechanism)

### DAG 1: The 1747 Understanding (Correct but Incomplete)

**Historical Context:** In 1747, James Lind discovered that lemons prevent scurvy through a controlled experiment. However, the understanding was incomplete - they knew lemons worked but not why.
```{python}
#| label: dag-1
#| echo: false
import daft
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a PGM object
pgm = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")

# Example of a professionally styled node
pgm.add_node("lem", "Lemons", 1, 1, aspect = 3, scale = 1.1,
             plot_params={
                 'facecolor': 'yellow', 
                 'edgecolor': 'orange', 
                 'linewidth': 2,
                 'alpha': 0.8,
             })
pgm.add_node("scu", "Scurvy", 3.25, 1, aspect = 3, scale = 1.1,
             plot_params={
                 'facecolor': 'thistle', 
                 'edgecolor': 'purple', 
                 'linewidth': 2,
                 'alpha': 0.8,
             })
pgm.add_edge("lem", "scu")

pgm.render()
plt.title("Simplified Lind's Model (1747)", fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', pad=20)
```

### DAG 2: The Misguided Belief (Wrong Understanding)

**Historical Context:** Over time, people came to believe it was the acid in lemons that killed bacteria which was causing scurvy. This led to lemons being replaced by limes (cheaper but less Vitamin C) or just using acids like vinegar, causing scurvy to return.

```{python}
#| label: dag-2-misguided
#| echo: false
import daft
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# Create a PGM object with wider x-axis to accommodate spaced-out nodes
pgm = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")
pgm.figure.set_size_inches(10, 4)  # Width x Height in inches

# Example of a professionally styled node - arranged in Z-shape
pgm.add_node("acid", "Acid", 1, 2.5, aspect = 3, scale = 1.1,
             plot_params={
                 'facecolor': 'green', 
                 'edgecolor': 'blue', 
                 'linewidth': 2,
                 'alpha': 0.8,
             })
pgm.add_node("bac", "Bacteria in\n Food", 3.75, 1.5, aspect = 3, scale = 1.1,
             plot_params={
                 'facecolor': 'lightcoral', 
                 'edgecolor': 'darkred', 
                 'linewidth': 2,
                 'alpha': 0.8,
             })
pgm.add_node("scu", "Scurvy", 6.5, 0.5, aspect = 3, scale = 1.1,
             plot_params={
                 'facecolor': 'thistle', 
                 'edgecolor': 'purple', 
                 'linewidth': 2,
                 'alpha': 0.8,
             })
pgm.add_edge("acid", "bac")
pgm.add_edge("bac","scu")
pgm.render()

```

### DAG 3: The 1928 Understanding (Complete and Correct)

**Historical Context:** In 1928, the true mechanism was discovered - it was Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) that prevented scurvy. This complete understanding finally explained why lemons worked and why the acid theory was wrong.
```{python}
#| label: dag-3-1928
#| echo: false
import daft
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# Create a PGM object with wider x-axis to accommodate spaced-out nodes
pgm = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")
pgm.figure.set_size_inches(10, 4)  # Width x Height in inches

# Example of a professionally styled node - arranged in Z-shape
pgm.add_node("vitc", "Vitamin C", 1, 2.5, aspect = 3, scale = 1.1,
             plot_params={
                 'facecolor': 'yellow', 
                 'edgecolor': 'orange', 
                 'linewidth': 2,
                 'alpha': 0.8,
             })
pgm.add_node("coll", "Collagen\n Synthesis", 3.75, 1.5, aspect = 3, scale = 1.1,
             plot_params={
                 'facecolor': 'lightblue', 
                 'edgecolor': 'darkblue', 
                 'linewidth': 2,
                 'alpha': 0.8,
             })
pgm.add_node("scu", "Scurvy", 6.5, 0.5, aspect = 3, scale = 1.1,
             plot_params={
                 'facecolor': 'thistle', 
                 'edgecolor': 'purple', 
                 'linewidth': 2,
                 'alpha': 0.8,
             })
pgm.add_edge("vitc", "coll")
pgm.add_edge("coll","scu")
pgm.render()
# Add a title
plt.title("Simplified Modern Understanding (1930s onwards)", fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', pad=20)
